# challenge-4-code-quiz

## Summary
This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code for the Code Quiz Challenge. This application utilizes dynamic DOM componenets to render a 5-question quiz. Upon starting the quiz, a 120-second timer starts. At the end of the quiz, the user's total score equals the amount of time left on the clock. When the user answers a question, a "correct" or "wrong" result displays towards the bottom of the page. If a question is answered wrong, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. Upon finishing the quiz, the final score is displayed and the user is notified whether their score is high enough to be added to the High Score List, which is limited to the Top 5 scores locally stored. If it is, the user is prompted to provide their initials, which is then saved to local storage along with the their score. If it is not, the user can start the quiz over or take a look at the Top 5 High Score List. The Top 5 list is sorted in descending order, and when viewing, the user has the option to clear the existing list of scores.
